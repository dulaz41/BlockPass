# BlockPass Smart Contract

Welcome to the BlockPass smart contract repository! BlockPass is a decentralized platform on the Polygon blockchain for creating and managing block passes, implemented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) following the ERC721 standard.

## Features

- Organizers can create and manage block passes for various events.
- Users can purchase block passes by acquiring NFTs.
- Block passes have attributes such as metadata, category, maximum pass count, pass price, start time, and sales end time.
- Secure handling of pass sales through blockchain transactions.
- Organizers receive the proceeds from pass sales, with a small fee deducted for platform maintenance.
- Users can track their acquired block passes and view events they've created.
- Events can be categorized, and users can search for events based on categories.
- Block passes can be removed by the organizer if no passes have been sold.
