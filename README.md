# BlockPass Ticketing Platform

BlockPass is a decentralized and transparent ticketing system designed to address the challenges of ticket fraud, high fees, and lack of transparency in traditional ticketing systems. The platform is built on the Avalanche blockchain, known for its high throughput and cost-effectiveness. By leveraging smart contracts following the ERC721 standard, BlockPass ensures a seamless integration that combines the scalability of Web2 with the verifiable compute and services of Web3.

## Key Features

### Decentralization and Transparency

BlockPass aims to provide a decentralized and transparent ticketing solution. By utilizing the Avalanche blockchain, the platform ensures that ticket transactions are secure, transparent, and resistant to fraud. The decentralized nature of the blockchain enhances trust in the ticketing process.

### ERC721 Standard Smart Contracts

Smart contracts play a crucial role in BlockPass, adhering to the ERC721 standard. This standard allows for the creation and management of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), representing unique and verifiable digital assets. Each ticket on the BlockPass platform is an NFT, providing ownership and provenance on the blockchain.

### Chainlink Price Feeds Integration

To ensure real-time and accurate pricing information, BlockPass integrates Chainlink Price Feeds. Chainlink's decentralized oracles provide reliable and tamper-proof data, establishing a bridge between Web2 scalability and the user-friendly experiences expected in ticketing platforms. This integration enhances overall efficiency and reliability.

### VRF V2 for Security and Unpredictability

BlockPass enhances security and unpredictability in its ticketing events, especially Limited Edition events, by incorporating Chainlink's VRF V2 (Verifiable Random Function). This feature adds an additional layer of randomness to the ticket allocation process, ensuring fairness and unpredictability in the distribution of Limited Edition tickets.

## Technology Stack

- **Avalanche Blockchain**: The platform's foundation, providing high throughput and cost-effective transactions.
- **ERC721 Standard Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts governing the creation, purchase, and management of NFT tickets.
- **Chainlink Price Feeds**: Integration for real-time and accurate pricing information.
- **VRF V2 (Verifiable Random Function)**: Enhances security and unpredictability in Limited Edition ticketing events.

## How to Use

1. **Create a New Block Pass**: Organizers can easily create new block passes by specifying details such as maximum passes, start time, sales end time, pass price, metadata, and category.

2. **Purchase Passes**: Users can seamlessly purchase standard passes or participate in Limited Edition events. Payments are made in cryptocurrency, ensuring efficiency and borderless transactions.

3. **Real-Time Pricing Information**: The integration of Chainlink Price Feeds ensures that users receive real-time and accurate pricing information, enhancing transparency in ticket pricing.

4. **Limited Edition Events with VRF V2**: Limited Edition ticketing events are conducted securely and fairly with the use of Chainlink's VRF V2, adding an element of unpredictability to the ticket allocation process.

5. **Decentralized and Transparent Ticketing**: The decentralized nature of the Avalanche blockchain ensures that ticket transactions are secure, transparent, and resistant to fraud.
